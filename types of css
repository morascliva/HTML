Inline CSS:

Inline CSS is applied directly within an HTML tag using the style attribute.
It affects only the specific element it's applied to.
Example: <p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>




Internal CSS (Embedded CSS):

Internal CSS is defined within the <style> element in the <head> section of an HTML document.
It applies styles to elements on the same page.


<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a green paragraph.</p>
</body>




External CSS:

External CSS is stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> element.
It allows styles to be shared across multiple HTML pages.
Example:



//html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p class="blue-text">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
</body>




//css
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}





Selector Types:

Selectors determine which HTML elements are affected by the styles.
There are different selector types: element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, and more.
Examples:
Element Selector: p { color: red; }
Class Selector: .highlight { background-color: yellow; }
ID Selector: #header { font-size: 24px; }









Cascading Order:

CSS stands for "Cascading" Style Sheets, which means styles can be inherited or overridden based on their specificity and the order they're defined.
Specificity is determined by the type of selector used and the number of selectors.
Styles that come later in the code can override earlier styles if they have higher specificity.








Media Queries:

Media queries are used to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics, such as screen width, height, or orientation.
They enable creating responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes.
Example:


@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
